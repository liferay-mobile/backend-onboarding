## Analytics 
Liferay Experience Cloud is a SaaS offering to enhance digital marketing activities through insights into the activities of a company’s customers across all touchpoints in the enterprise, whether or not those touchpoints are on the Liferay platform. Experience Cloud will enable you to gather analytics on three different dimensions: about people, their interactions and their customer journeys.

Meanwhile, the Liferay Recife team is developing the analytics about the interactions of the individuals with content, both in the touchpoint (e.g., scroll depth on a landing page) and asset level (e.g., form field leading to abandonment), that leads to insights into which touchpoints or assets are the best performing.
